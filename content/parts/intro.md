# Introduction

**TODO: blah blah about time series, how important they are, _etc._.**

This document is an attempt to summarize my recent work related to the design of
machine learning methods specifically tailored to handle structured data such
as graphs (in [Sec. 1.3](01/ot.html)) or time series (in the rest of the
document).
However, note that one of my contributions to the field is not developed in
this document (or just marginally in its
[Jupyter notebook](https://rtavenar.github.io/hdr/) form). It concerns open
source software development, especially through the creation and
maintenance of [`tslearn`](https://tslearn.readthedocs.io)
{% cite tslearn %}.

Coming back to the current document, my contributions are organized in two
parts, the first one being dedicated to the design of adequate similarity
measures between structured data, while the second one focuses on methods that
learn latent representations for temporal data.
