# Conclusion and Perspectives

**TODO**

A list of perspectives that could be discussed:

* Gromov-DTW (and Siamese nets to learn it efficiently)
* Metric learning for time series alignments
* Domain Adaptation
* Few-shot learning (related to representations)
  * citer le papier de Dustin Tran
    * generative models for various tasks
      * cast the problem as structured prediction (predict emission times also)
* More on problem-driven: eg. Agricultural practices
* Make tslearn more generalist (cover more basic stats models, more tasks)
