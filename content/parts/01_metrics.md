# Defining adequate metrics for structured data

This section covers my works related to the definition of new metrics for
structured data such as time series or graphs.
Three tracks are investigated.
First, in [Sec. 1.1](01/temporal_kernel.html), time series are seen as discrete
distributions over the feature-time product space and a kernel is defined that
efficiently compares such representations.
Second, in [Sec. 1.2](01/dtw.html), time series are treated as sequences, which
means that only ordering is of importance (not time delay between observations)
and variants of the Dynamic Time Warping algorithm are used.
Finally, in [Sec. 1.3](01/ot.html), graphs are seen as **TODO**.
