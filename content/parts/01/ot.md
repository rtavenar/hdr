# Optimal Transport for Structured Data

<!-- #region {"tags": ["popout"]} -->
**Note.** This work was part of Titouan Vayer's PhD thesis.
We were co-supervising Titouan together with Laetitia Chapel and Nicolas Courty.
<!-- #endregion -->

This section covers my works related to Optimal Transport distances for
structured data such as graphs.

## Wasserstein and Gromov-Wasserstein distances

**TODO**

## Fused Gromov-Wasserstein

**TODO**

**TODO: at some point, highlight Sliced Gromov Wasserstein also.**
