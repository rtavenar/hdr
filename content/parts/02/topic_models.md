# Temporal Topic Models

Topic models are mixture models that can deal with documents represented as
bags of features (BoF) and extract latent topics (a topic being a distribution
over features) from a corpus of documents.
For these methods, time series are hence seen as bags of timestamped features.
In the methods presented here, the temporal dimension is either
[included in the BoF representation](#Supervised-Hierarchical-Dirichlet-Latent-Semantic-Motifs)
or added
[in a refinement step](#Two-step-Inference-for-Sequences-of-Ornstein-Uhlenbeck-Processes).
