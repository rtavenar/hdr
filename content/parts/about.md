[^1]: In France, the _Habilitation Ã  Diriger des Recherches_ (HDR) is a diploma
    that is required to (i) formally be a PhD supervisor (before that, one can
    only co-supervise) and (ii) apply for Professor positions. See
    [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habilitation) for more details.
